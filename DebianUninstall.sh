# I make this script publicly available under the term "public domain software."
# You can do whatever you want with it because it is truly freeâ€”unlike so-called "free" software with conditions, like the GNU licenses and other similar nonsense.
# If you're so eager to talk about freedom, then make it truly free.
# You don't have to accept any terms of use or license to use or modify it, because it comes with no CopyLeft.
